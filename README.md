# About the project
I have created this project to use all the knowledge I have learned about **React & React Tool Kit.** I have tried to use most of the things that a framework / library can provide to build applications.

*   **Components:**

*   Create custom components looking for reusability
*   Using Props
*   Using Emitters
*   Access to DOM elements
*   Creating views with bussiness logic
*   Creating reusable hooks

*   **Router:**

*   Using React Router **v6.7.0**
*   Creating all routes with Lazzy Load
*   Using Guards in differents pages
*   Control active route
*   Using Main Routes and Child Routes
*   Creating simple men√∫

*   **Redux:**

*   Split store in modules, based in app requirements, looking for easy maintenance
*   Create API structure, using **RTK Query** for avoid duplicate calls and improve performance
*   Using Slices
*   Create custom reducers for every Slice

*   **Extras:**

*   I create a fake login, the objective is that when a user is logged in, to persist that login avoiding to lose the user when the page is refreshed. The main objective is not to show the login page if the user is logged in and in case the user is NOT logged in, to avoid enter in any path of the application.
